    private String[] predictions = {"It's clear your future lies in the church. But they won't have you. You don't eat fast food or have any clue where their trash goes. Romance is very definitely in the air...wait, that's doughnuts. You'll throw out your back eating a taco this week. No one will ever see your moments of quiet desperation, because your complaints are louder than a screech owl singing Lady Gaga. If you're not in pain when making those sounds, you soon will be when your co-workers catch up to you.", "Go with the waffles instead of the pancakes. People like you make me sick. Your next Career: Roadkill Cleanup Enforcement. You will get a worthless coupon in the mail. Just when you're ready to stop and smell the roses someone comes along and snips them for a bouquet. Quit relying on everyone else's schedule and plant your own flowers. That way, you'll at least sniff them once before the deer eat them.", "The receptionist is reading your mail. You iron your clothes by sleeping with them sandwiched between the mattress and box-spring. Likewise, you can stretch one pair of underwear out for almost a month. Your next career: Gangster Florist. Your every fleeting thought is a pearl. The holidays are about spending time with loved ones, then going home and visiting the ones you can tolerate. At the end of the week, you've earned that special gift hidden on the top shelf in the closet.", "Big success and crushing failure this week! You are often found opening and shutting the refrigerator door, attempting to trick the light inside. Your next Career: Unknown Graphic Novelist. You have a great singing voice, stop hoarding it! That month-long Netflix binge has left you groggy and your house a spiderweb-covered mess. On the bright side, all you need is a few sheets thrown over your furniture and you can make some cash by opening it as a haunted house.", "Your neighbor harbors a deep resentment. You like to psychoanalyze your friends but have no real experience with life in general. Your smile scares children. Eat in more and eat more when you eat. You have something stuck in your craw, but that's okay. It's time to power wash those old opinions out of there anyway. Put on goggles and hand the hose to your BFF. Hey, what could go wrong?", "You should take that chance you've been debating on for weeks! I know you're being cautious, but time to shake it off and just DO IT! If it pays off, it could make you happy. You could receive love, a new horse, some very clean money or a year with a Jehovah Witness! If it goes badly, all you will have lost is your sanity which wasn't really there to begin with, some good lasagna, a toenail or your car. Whatever the case, at least you'll get to see some entertaining people this week that you won't have to pay for! You are oh-so-elegant and tasteful to the point of incurring nausea from loved ones. You are also bipolar as hell and can't make a decision on your own. Baked goods are in abundance. Succeeding at sucking is not really success. The future doesn't have anything in store for you; it's all kept in the warehouse, and comes to you via two-day shipping. Be careful when you order from the website, though. That return policy is tough.", "You will be eaten by coyotes. You have something in your teeth. Good things come in ones. An orphaned hillbilly boy will begin living in your fireplace. Nothing's better than good friends and cheap wine, although the reverse will do in a pinch. Make merry on Saturday, because you'll have a lot to forget, especially Friday night.", "Your seats for the show will be abysmal. You will lose at pool this weekend. You were visited by aliens last night and, based on you, they found our species not worth investigating further. You will get a worthless coupon in the mail. Some unexpected cash will flow into your day tomorrow; catch it before it circles the drain and leaves you not so high and way too dry.", "Your life is a series of ups and downs. Like a toilet plunger. A large windfall is coming to you. Only it's meteorological and not financial. Give encouragement to the hopeless dregs that idolize you. An orphaned hillbilly boy will begin living in your fireplace. Stomp all you want, but you won't get your way. Once karma sees your temper tantrum, you'll be in a cosmic time out while everyone else enjoys free ice cream and unicorn rides."};
